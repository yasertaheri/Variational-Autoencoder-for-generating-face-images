# Variational Autoencoder for generating face images

It is an implemrentation of Variational Autoencoder for generating face images trained on 200,000 images in ClebA dataset.

For training, images in ClebA dataset were tured into greysclae image and then resized to [80,80] images.

Some new fictional faces generated by using the decoder part of Variational Autoencoder :
